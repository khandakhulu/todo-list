How to use this workflow

The workflow presented in this chapter was designed for both beginners and
experienced users. It is also used a lot of time in Open Source projects so many
developers use it already. Keep in mind that this workflow is not set in stone, and it can
be tweaked to suit your demands, within reasons.
My suggestion is to follow the workflow religiously when you are still a beginner, so that
you can get how it all works and what are the rituals to go through. When you are feeling
a little bit experienced, you can modify the workflow a little bit if that make you more
efficient; but never forfeit security for time. Bypassing some rituals might gain you some
time, but if it leads to more bugs and merge conflicts, it would be counterproductive. After
youâ€™ve used Git and GitHub for a few years, you will become a Master of It and can create
your own workflow, provided that what you will bring will make your team more efficient
